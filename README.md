> Not sure about all of them, since this is port of libanki and the names were decided by Damien, but the cryptic ones:

> 1. crt: created time
> 1. ver: collection version
> 1. scm: schema version
> 1. dty: dirty flag?
> 1. usn: universal serial number, used during syncs
> 1. dconf: deck configuration
> 1. mid: model id
> 1. cid: card id
> 1. nid: note id
> 1. did: deck id
> 1. oid: old id
> 1. odid: old deck id
> 1. ivl: interval
> 1. reps: number of repetitions
> 1. ord: ordinal?
> 1. csum: checksum
> 1. flds: fields
> 1. odue: old due value
